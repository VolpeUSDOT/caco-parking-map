# Cape Cod National Seashore Parking Management Web Map
NPMap based application for parking management system developed by Volpe with the National Park Service Northeast Region and Cape Cod National Seashore.

Client-side code for parking management system developed by Volpe with the National Park Service (NPS) Northeast Region and Cape Cod National Seashore. This parking management system keeps track of how many spaces are occupied/available at NPS beach parking lots on Cape Cod National Seashore and shares this information with the public. Tracking parking lot congestion helps Cape Cod visitors plan their trips and also helps park staff plan and allocate resources.

This project has two main components: a map created using the NPMap.js library, and a table as an alternative way of displaying the information.
